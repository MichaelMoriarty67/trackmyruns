# TrackMyRuns
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **WHAT?** TrackMyRuns is a full stack app for tracking exercise routes that I built to learn more about RESTful API design. 
The app allow users to stream geolocation time-series data from client to server while moving to build a 'RunMap'.
RunMaps get plotted against a map by the client to visualize exercise routes.
Additional features includes the ability to authenticate as user, see your aggregated exercise data, and see details analytics on specific runs.  

üìñ **WHAT I LEARNED?** I purposfully did not use Django REST Framework to learn more about _request parsing_, _data serialization_, and _response formatting_.

*p.s. yes... I'm a Strava fanboy if you're wondering.*

**Frontend**: React  
**Backend**: Django  
**Database**: PostgreSQL
